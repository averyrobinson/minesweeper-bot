Flagging
--------

1. If for a number, A, we have
   rem(A) = N(unclicked_neighbors(A)) + N(flagged_neighbors(A))
   then flag all unclicked_neighbors(A).

2. If a number, A, with rem(A) /= 0, has a set of neighbors that are also numbers, Bs,
   such that the unclicked neighbors of each B are all neighbors of A,
   and unclicked_neighbors(A) \ union_over_B(unclicked_neighbors(B)) nonempty,
   and rem(A) - sum_over_B(rem(B)) = N(unclicked_neighbors(A) \
         union_over_B(unclicked_neighbors(B)))
   then flag all unclicked_neighbors(A) \ union_over_B(unclicked_neighbors(B)).

Clicking
--------

1. If for a number, A, we have
   rem(A) == 0
   then click all unclicked neighbors.

2. If a number, A, has a set of neighbors that are also numbers, Bs, s.t.
   unclicked_neighbors(A) \ union_over_B(unclicked_neighbors(B)) nonempty,
   and all sets unclicked_neighbors(B) are disjoint,
   and rem(A) = sum_over_B(
                  rem(B) - N(unclicked_neighbors(B) \ unclicked_neighbors(A))
                )
   then click all unclicked_neighbors(A) \ union_over_B(unclicked_neighbors(B)).
